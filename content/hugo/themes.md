It was not so easy to find the appropriate theme for this short experiment:
- The `learn` theme is great, but I was not able to embed HTML content that uses `requirejs` (e.g. Jupyter widgets or interactive tables).
- The `ananke` theme has no such issue, but I was missing the navigation menu.
- The `hugo-book` theme looks great, but I wanted a button to go to the next chapter.
- The `hugo-theme-techdoc` works super well! It even has the _edit on GitHub_ link.
