# First Steps with Hugo

Can we use Hugo to build a static site made of Jupyter notebooks?

The answer is probably yes! - See how the inputs that you find in most notebooks: code, text, images, tables or interative plots are rendered at https://my-first-steps-with-hugo.netlify.com/.

If you want to render the site locally, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), and then execute
```
git clone git@github.com:mwouts/first_steps_with_hugo.git
cd first_steps_with_hugo
hugo serve -D
```
